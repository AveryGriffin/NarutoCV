In this project, I created a Computer Vision based Naruto game.......BELIEVE IT!!!

<p>&nbsp
</p>

The aim was to bring the Naruto world to life. Namely, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize Naruto hand signs.

From there, I recreated a simplied version of the classic Naruto Arena game that incorporated the hand recognition model. The result: a game where you 'attack' by preforming Naruto-style hand signs to activate jutsus!

I wrote a quick blog post about the project on my website https://engineeringsapien.com/narutocv-blog. You can learn more about it there. Currently, the only way to play it is to download the code from my github here. I have instructions for doing so on the blog post.

Disclaimer:
There are several parties for which I owe a lot credit to. Namely:

Naruto-Arena - The whole game idea was pretty much just a copy of Naruto Arena. So I owe the creators of that gem a big thank you. In fact, most of the character icons and attack icons I used in the game I got from their website. I don't think I am nearly as talented as the NA creators plus I made my version in Python (PyGame) plus I didn't spend that much time on it, hence why my version is inferior.

VGG16 - This is the deep learning model I used in this project. It is a model by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman. Here is their paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556

Brenner Heintz - A major help was Brenner Heintz. For a while, I struggled to get the model to learn anything and it wasn't until I came across Brenner's article did things start to come together. It was Brenner who convinced me to use the VGG16 model as well as thresholded images instead of colored images.

The Internet - And of course, I must give a big thanks to the countless number of people on StackOverflow, Youtube, and the internet as a whole who provided the knowledge (and tutorials) to do half the things I tried doing (let's be honest....SO is the author of this project).

Masashi Kishimoto - It goes without saying but the holders of the copyrighted and/or trademarked material appearing in this project belong to NARUTO Â© 2002 MASASHI KISHIMOTO. All Rights Reserved.
