Here is a machine learning+Pygame joint project.

The aim is to create a pygame version of the classic Naruto Arena online turn-based strategy game....but with a twist.
Instead of just clicking on attacks and characters, you perform the jutsus with your hands! Anyone familiar with the show Naruto, knows
how jutsus are performed via handsigns. Well this game uses that concept. Using the camera on your computer and a Deep Convolution Neural Network,
the gestures you make with your hands are translated to attacks in the game.

Woohoo!
